# CSF215 Final Project: Adaptive Headlamps
A logic circuit that controls headlights of a car simulated in [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). 
In addition to controlling the headlights depending on the surronding ambient light, the circuit also automatically dims the headlights when an approacing vehicle is detected to prevent accidents.
